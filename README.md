This is a repo for OpenNet's interview.  
To run the tests, go to Actions > Run Tests and rerun the latest workflow run.  
After that, the pages-build-deployment workflow will run, and the test results in https://melpeln.github.io/opennet-e2e/ will be updated. (There seems to be an issue where if the page was recently opened, it will only redirect the user to the last seen version instead of the newest version. Please use incognito mode to work around this.)
